Question here: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working with others or if you needed to access your local work from another physical location.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because that might introduce stuff from other people contributing that you don't want, among  other things depending on the project.
