Question here: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working with others or if you needed to access your local work from another physical location.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because that might introduce stuff from other people contributing that you don't want, among  other things depending on the project.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a github clone, a branch is an addition to a repository, a clone is a copy of a repository. Forks are used for github to github clones, while branches generally add new content and commits either locally or on github.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
That is needed to reconcile your local changes with changes made to the remote by someone else (at least changes independent of those on your local machine. )
